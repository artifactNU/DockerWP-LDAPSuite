## Troubleshooting

This section provides solutions to common issues you might encounter while setting up or running the DockerWP-LDAPSuite. 

### Docker Containers Do Not Start

- **Issue**: Docker containers fail to start or exit unexpectedly after launch.
- **Solution**: Check the Docker container logs for any error messages. You can use `docker logs <container_name>` to view logs for a specific container. Common issues include misconfiguration in `docker-compose.yml`, insufficient permissions, or port conflicts.

### Database Connection Errors

- **Issue**: WordPress cannot connect to the MySQL database.
- **Solution**: 
  1. Ensure the MySQL container is running. 
  2. Verify that environment variables for database connections (`MYSQL_USER`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD`, `WORDPRESS_DB_HOST`) are correctly configured in `docker-compose.yml`.
  3. Check MySQL logs for any errors using `docker logs DWLS-mysql`.

### LDAP Connection Issues

- **Issue**: Cannot connect to the OpenLDAP server or phpLDAPadmin.
- **Solution**: 
  1. Verify that the OpenLDAP container is up and running.
  2. Check that the LDAP service's port mappings are correctly configured and not in conflict with other services.
  3. Ensure the environment variables for LDAP (`LDAP_DOMAIN`, `LDAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD`) are correctly set.

### Failed to Generate LDAP Users

- **Issue**: The script to generate LDAP users fails.
- **Solution**: 
  1. Ensure you're running the script inside the LDAP container (`docker exec -it DWLS-openldap bash`).
  2. Confirm that the CSV file is correctly formatted and accessible within the container.
  3. Check the script for any hard-coded values that might need adjustment, such as the LDAP admin password.

### Backup or Restore Process Fails

- **Issue**: Unable to backup or restore Docker volumes successfully.
- **Solution**: 
  1. Verify that the Alpine container has access to all necessary volumes.
  2. Ensure the backup scripts are executable (`chmod +x script_name.sh`).
  3. Check the backup and restore scripts for any hardcoded paths or values that don't match your environment.

### General Docker Networking Issues

- **Issue**: Containers cannot communicate with each other.
- **Solution**: 
  1. Inspect your Docker network settings and ensure all containers are on the same network.
  2. Check for any firewall rules that might be blocking traffic between containers.
  3. Use Docker's built-in networking troubleshooting tools to diagnose and resolve issues.

### Adminer or phpLDAPadmin Interface Not Accessible

- **Issue**: The web interfaces for Adminer or phpLDAPadmin do not load.
- **Solution**: 
  1. Check that the container ports are correctly mapped to the host and not blocked by a firewall.
  2. Verify that the services are correctly configured to use the network settings defined in `docker-compose.yml`.
  3. Ensure there's no local service running on the same ports as Adminer (8080) or phpLDAPadmin (8081).

If you encounter issues not covered here, please open an issue in the project's GitHub repository or consult the Docker and OpenLDAP documentation for more in-depth troubleshooting.
